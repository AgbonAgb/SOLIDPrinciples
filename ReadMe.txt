Virtual methods have an implementation and provide the derived classes with
the option of overriding it. Abstract methods do not provide an implementation
and force the derived classes to override the method


If you have a Class and create another Class from it, it becomes a parent and the new Class becomes a child.
The child Class should be able to do everything the parent Class can do.This process is called Inheritance.

The picture shows that the parent Class delivers Coffee(it could be any type of coffee).
It is acceptable for the child Class to deliver Cappucino because it is a specific type of Coffee, but it is NOT acceptable to deliver Water.
